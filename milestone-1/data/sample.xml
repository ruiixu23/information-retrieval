  <TEXT>   More than 150 former officers of theoverthrown South Vietnamese government have been released from are-education camp after 13 years of detention, the official VietnamNews Agency reported Saturday.   The report from Hanoi, monitored in Bangkok, did not givespecific figures, but said those freed Friday included anex-Cabinet minister, a deputy minister, 10 generals, 115field-grade officers and 25 chaplains.   It quoted Col. Luu Van Ham, director of the Nam Ha camp south ofHanoi, as saying all 700 former South Vietnamese officials who hadbeen held at the camp now have been released.   They were among 1,014 South Vietnamese who were to be releasedfrom re-education camps under an amnesty announced by the Communistgovernment to mark Tet, the lunar new year that begins Feb. 17.   The Vietnam News Agency report said many foreign journalists anda delegation from the Australia-Vietnam Friendship Associationattended the Nam Ha release ceremony.   It said Lt. Gen. Nguyen Vinh Nghi, former commander of SouthVietnam's Third Army Corps, and Col. Tran Duc Minh, former directorof the Army Infantry Officers School, expressed ``gratitude to thegovernment for its humane treatment in spite of the fact that mostof them (detainees) had committed heinous crimes against thecountry and people.''   The prisoners had been held without formal charges or trialsince North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnamesegovernment in April 1975, ending the Vietnam War.   Communist authorities had called the prisoners war criminals andsaid they had to learn how to become citizens of the new society.   Small numbers had been released occasionally without publicitybut the government announced last year that 480 political prisonerswould be freed to mark National Day on Sept. 2.   On Thursday, Vice Minister of Information Phan Quang said 1,014would be released under the Tet amnesty.   He reported a total of 150 prisoners would remain in the camps,which he said once held 100,000.   ``Depending on their repentance, they will gradually be releasedwithin a short period of time,'' Quang said.   He said many of the former inmates would return to theirfamilies in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly the South Vietnamese capitalof Saigon.   The amnesties apparently are part of efforts by Communist Partychief Nguyen Van Linh to heal internal divisions and improveVietnam's image abroad.</TEXT>
